# International-Space-Station-Tracker
The International Space Station moves at close to 28,000 km/h so its location changes really fast!

It's about eight-and-a-half times as fast as a Bullet (Rifle). In other words, 28,000 kilometers per hour is 8.5 times the speed of a Bullet (Rifle), and the speed of a Bullet (Rifle) is 0.118 times that amount. - https://www.themeasureofthings.com/
