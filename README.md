# International-Space-Station-Tracker

## Overview
The International Space Station moves at close to 28,000 km/h so its location changes really fast!

It's about eight-and-a-half times as fast as a Bullet (Rifle). In other words, 28,000 kilometers per hour is 8.5 times the speed of a Bullet (Rifle), and the speed of a Bullet (Rifle) is 0.118 times that amount. - https://www.themeasureofthings.com/

## Key Topics

The following topics were covered in this project:
* The science of ISS' speed
  * The Measure of Things

* Programming Language
  * Python 

* Library and APIs used
  * pandas - Python Data Analysis Lbrary
  * Plotly Express - A terse, consistent, high-level API for creating figures 
  * Open Notify - Open APIs from Space

## Comprehension Check

You will understand more about the project if you can answer the following questions:

1. Why is the space station up there?
2. Why is it important for the location of the ISS to be accessible and transparent to the world?

## Learning Objectives

You will appreciate the project if you are able to:
* Study more about NASA's awesome data for the ISS 📚
* Implement further exploratory data analysis with the data through pandas library 🔍
* Build and deploy a software app that educates people about the ISS and space 🌌🛰🚀

## Homework: Tinker with my project 🤗🛠

Take the provided codebase and tinker with it to make it accessible for space enthusiasts. Don't forget the cardinal rule when working with someone elses code:
"Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it".
